    Developed the input_employee_data() function in net_pay_calculator.py to prompt and validate employee information.

    Created and ran multiple test cases for this function using pytest (all tests passed).

    Fixed environment setup issues by configuring a virtual environment and installing dependencies.

    Collaborated actively via GitHub, ensuring code quality and pushing updates regularly.

    Available for follow-up support or troubleshooting if needed.
